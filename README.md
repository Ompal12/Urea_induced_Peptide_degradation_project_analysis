# Urea_induced_Peptide_degradation_project_analysis
The repository includes scripts for the coordination number for urea around peptide residues, per-residue preferential binding, urea-aromatic stacking interactions, temperature and concentration effects on urea adsorption.

This repository contains the analysis scripts, and supporting data used in the paper: "Residue-Specific Conformational Changes Reveal Neuropeptide Degradation under Urea and Thermal Stress"
